# Development

Becoming proficient in development requires more than just understanding the fundamentals of frameworks and languages; it demands hands-on experience. Start with a course to grasp the basics, but focus on working on multiple personal and group projects. These projects will help you develop essential skills, such as reading documentation, debugging code, problem-solving, and exploring various solutions to pick the best one for your use case. Avoid falling into the trap of endlessly watching tutorials—stick to one initially and start working on a project alongside it. Learning development is a long and ongoing journey, but it’s a rewarding and fulfilling path for coding enthusiasts.
