# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

Delving into Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) requires a deep commitment to learning a broad range of theories, including mathematical foundations, core ML concepts, and practical implementations. You'll also need to keep up with the latest cutting-edge advancements in the field. A strong understanding of mathematics is crucial, so if you're not confident in your math skills, take the time to strengthen them before diving into specific topics. Working on projects is essential, as they provide tangible outcomes that help you assess your understanding and problem-solving abilities when faced with unexpected challenges. Additionally, developing the ability to read research papers is a critical skill if you want to make significant strides in this field.
