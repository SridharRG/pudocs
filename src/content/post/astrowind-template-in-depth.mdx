# Preparing for Internships: A Comprehensive Guide

## Summary

This guide covers the essential resources and strategies to prepare for internships, focusing on topics that are most likely to be assessed during the application process. Below, you'll find a categorized list of resources, along with links and descriptions to help you navigate your preparation journey effectively.

### Requirements by Companies
Before diving into preparation, it's essential to understand the expectations and requirements set by companies. This includes the level of proficiency required, the competition you might face, and the time needed to complete different stages of the application process.

- **Level to Prepare To**: Companies typically expect strong problem-solving skills, knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and proficiency in system design. Some might also test your understanding of computer science fundamentals.
- **Competition**: Expect stiff competition, especially from peers who have been rigorously preparing through platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.
- **Time to Complete Stages**: Depending on the company, the application process might involve multiple stages, including online assessments, technical interviews, and system design interviews. Allocating 3-6 months for thorough preparation is advisable.
