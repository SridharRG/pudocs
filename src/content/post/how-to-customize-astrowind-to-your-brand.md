# DSA & Competitive Programming (CP)

Building a solid foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (DSA) is crucial before diving into problem-solving from various sheets. Ensure you grasp time complexity, algorithm design, and the programming language you're planning to code in. It's essential to practice consistently and revise the problems you've solved previously. Mastery in DSA and CP involves familiarizing yourself with common patterns and algorithms, often learned from problems you initially struggle with.

## Purely for Interview & Online Assessment Preparation

- **[Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2):**  
  This sheet covers DSA comprehensively and is perfect for thorough preparation.

- **[Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/):**  
  A shorter version suitable if you have only a few months to prepare.

- **[Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice):**  
  A curated list of 150 essential coding problems for interviews.

- **[CodeHelp DSA Sheet](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problem-lists/love-babbar-dsa-sheet-problems):**  
  Another great resource for structured DSA problem-solving.

  Explains the theory behind many CP problems.

- **[USACO Training](https://usaco.training/):**  
  A series of lessons with corresponding problems to enhance your programming skills.

- **[TopCoder Competitive Programming Tutorials](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/search?tags[]=Competitive%20Programming%20Tutorials):**  
  Great articles on various data structures and algorithms used in CP.

- **[CP Course Material from a University](https://github.com/SuprDewd/T-414-AFLV):**  
  Course material with follow-up problems for each topic.

- **[Self-Paced DSA & CP Practice](https://github.com/The-CODE-Plus-Plus-Community/Competitive-Programming-and-DSA):**  
  A repository for self-paced DSA and CP practice.

## Final Thoughts

Whether you're preparing for interviews or improving your competitive programming skills, consistency and practice are key. Make sure to revise and familiarize yourself with the patterns and algorithms, as they play a crucial role in solving complex problems. Happy coding!
